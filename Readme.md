# Here is where I learn Markdown.

 You can watch at here [GitHub](https://github.com/WJHPrince/Markdown)

## First is lists, you can make lists like this:

1.  One2.  Two3.  Three

Or like this: 

*   One*   Two

Sometimes we may need this:

*   One
        *   1
    *   2

            <span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">'hello linux'</span>

**Attention** please, i don't know what's going wrong that few statements cannot be recognized correctly, I will find out later.
